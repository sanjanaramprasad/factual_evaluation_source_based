Jess: Knowing my luck, Charlie might be the closest to the truth.
Charlie: Do you really believe that dreams can mean something?
Jess: No, of course not! I was just joking. It was such a surreal dream that I had to share it with you ;)
Lynn: Well...
Jess: Do you believe in dreams, Lynn?
Lynn: I''m not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it''s just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don''t you think?
Jess: I guess? 
Charlie: I''ve read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people''s faces, and it uses them when we dream.
Jess: So you''re telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood?
Charlie: Exactly! You don''t even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage.
Lynn: WOW, it sounds really cool!"
