Kai: yes, I remember quite well 😋

Kai: and then?
Michael: I don’t have an answer to that one yet, and it’s not really a solution because I’d need to work 2 months notice period anyway, but I’ve just lost motivation after 3 years
Kai: Would you like to leave London?
Michael: yes asap
Kai: for the Netherlands?
Michael: maybe to recharge and look for jobs abroad, but I don't want to stay there. I know it’s not smart to quit without an alternative
Kai: depends on the field. I don't know yours and your experience. But it can be a bit stressful also
Michael: true, in my field it wouldn’t be good. Anyway I need to speak to my manager and discuss because I’m not happy in my job now. How’s everything on your side? too much work?
Kai: yes, I basically never rest these days
