580,test_382,"#Person1#: Police in North London are treating as murder the death of a man thought to be in his forties whose body was found in a pedestrian subway in Neasden. The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning.
#Person2#: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.
#Person1#: About what time would you think that they were there?
#Person2#: Just after half past one to a quarter past two.
#Person1#: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes.
#Person2#: In fact, yes, as short as that.
#Person1#: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?
#Person2#: Fifty meters.
#Person1#: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time?
#Person2#: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well.

#Person2#: I see. So let me get this straight. If I borrow let's say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?
#Person1#: It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate. This of course is considering that you don't default on a payment!
#Person2#: It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.
#Person1#: That is a very serious problem you see, the bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan.
