I'd always gone to school by car. Catching a bus would be better, but there's no bus where we live. So I've gone for riding my bike to school now.\n#Person1#: OK. And what about being green once you're actually at school?\n#Person2#: Well, I realized that although all school paper was recycled and most of my friends use both sides of paper. We use huge quantities and I thought we should cut down and then it came to me that we should be sending in most of our work electronically. I'm going to recommend it to our teachers.\n#Person1#: And what about the school cafeteria?\n#Person2#: One school I've read about has meatless Mondays. It's good to use local produce, too.
