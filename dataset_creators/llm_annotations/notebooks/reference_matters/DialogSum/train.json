I'm invited to go to a friend's wedding, but while I'm there, I'd also like to do some sightseeing.\n#Person2#: That's nice, Sherry. But do you mean the province of Quebec or Quebec City?\n#Person1#: I mean the province. My friend's wedding is in Montreal, so I'm going there first. I'll stay for 5 days. Is Montreal the capital city of the province?\n#Person2#: Well, many people think so because it's the biggest city, but it's not the capital. Quebec City is, but Montreal is great. The Santa Lawrence River runs right through the middle of the city. It's beautiful in summer.\n#Person1#: Wow, and do you think I can get by in English? My French is okay, but not that good. I know most people there speak French, but can I also use English?\n#Person2#: Well, people speak both French and English there, but you'll hear French most of the time and all the street signs are in French. In fact, Montreal is the third largest French-speaking city in the world. So you'd better practice your French before you go.\n#Person1#: Good advice, what about Quebec City? I'll visit a friend from college who lives there now. What's it like?\n#Person2#: It's a beautiful city, very old. Many old buildings have been nicely restored. Some of them were built in the 17th and 18th centuries. You'll love it there.\n#Person1#: Fantastic. I can't wait to go.",

There are two sides to every story. I don't understand it and I have no intention of going to a demonstration. Demonstrations don't seem to accomplish anything anyway.\n#Person1#: Several demonstrations have changed politician's minds throughout history. As a responsible citizen I think it is important to stand up for what you believe in.\n#Person2#: Leave it to someone else. As I said, if you listen to both sides of a story, both sides have some good points. Why should I demonstrate and risk getting hurt for something that I am not even sure is right?\n#Person1#: You are not likely to get hurt. This will be a peaceful demonstration. I have spoken to the organizer for the university group. He insists that this will be peaceful. He advocates if you want world peace, peace begins at home-and that means right here in this city.\n#Person2#: You go if you want, Simon, but I plan to study for my physics exam.\n#Person1#: It would only take two hours of your day. The bus leaves the campus at 11:30 and leaves downtown to return to campus at 12:45. You could eat your lunch on the bus.\n#Person2#: I am not going, Simon. Why don't you ask the students in your political science class this afternoon if they want to go?\n#Person1#: They are all going.\n#Person2#: Okay, Simon. I need to meet my sister for coffee now.\n#Person1#: Bye then. See you in physics class tomorrow.",

Pull up a chair. \n#Person1#: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \n#Person2#: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \n#Person1#: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \n#Person2#: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \n#Person1#: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \n#Person2#: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \n#Person1#: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. \n#Person2#: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some explanation. \n#Person1#: Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later! ",

He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.\n#Person1#: About what time would you think that they were there?\n#Person2#: Just after half past one to a quarter past two.\n#Person1#: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes.\n#Person2#: In fact, yes, as short as that.\n#Person1#: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?\n#Person2#: Fifty meters.\n#Person1#: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time?\n#Person2#: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well.\n#Person1#: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them.\n#Person2#: No, not at this stage.\n#Person1#: Well, thank you very much.",

I'm originally from Queens but moved down to Manhattan a while back. So. . . you're an expat in China. . . how's life over here working out for you? \n#Person3#: You know - I really love it. There are frustrations of course, such as traffic, pollution and the language barrier, but all in all, I give China a big thumbs up. \n#Person1#: Before you two get carried away in conversation, let's finalize our plans for the evening. I was thinking of dining at a well-known dumpling restaurant and then hitting a Karaoke bar for some fun! \n#Person2#: Everything sounded good until I heard the word 'Karaoke'. If there's one thing you don't want to hear, it's me singing. \n#Person3#: I sound like a frog that's suffering from a bad cold! But Karaoke is so popular in Asia that I've been dragged to at least two dozen of them so far. I've even learned a Chinese song or two. \n#Person1#: Hey. . . no Karaoke. . . no problem! We're here to have fun and if singing isn't fun. . . then forget it! I assume you like beer. \n#Person2#: Beer is quite possibly my very favorite liquid. \n#Person3#: Chinese beer is actually pretty good. I've sampled all of them so I should know! \n#Person1#: Great! So we'll have dinner and then we'll go down to the bar district. In Beijing there are literally thousands of bars. \n#Person2#: Sounds like a plan. ",

In fact, I'm still not feeling well.\n#Person1#: Yes, I can see that. What was the problem?\n#Person2#: The doctor thinks it was food poisoning. I went to a nice restaurant for lunch with a few of my classmates last Sunday. It was a great meal. So many dishes, barbecued beef, roast mutton and lots of vegetables.\n#Person1#: Sounds delicious.\n#Person2#: Yeah, it was. But on my way home I got some fried chicken to eat from a street store. Not long after I got home I started feeling sick.\n#Person1#: Are you thinking that is what caused your illness?\n#Person2#: Well, it must have been. No one else who ate the lunch got sick. Anyway, I'm feeling a little better now.\n#Person1#: I'm glad to hear that, and are you able to keep up with all your lessons?\n#Person2#: Yes, my classmates have been bringing me their notebooks and I can download the biology lessons from the Internet.\n#Person1#: Oh yes, it is really a good idea.",

If I borrow let's say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?\n#Person1#: It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate. This of course is considering that you don't default on a payment!\n#Person2#: It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.\n#Person1#: That is a very serious problem you see, the bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan.\n#Person2#: You know what?

So first, right off the bat, When looking at the marketing plan, tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with...\n#Person2#: We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also, in line with that goal, redo our image...\n#Person1#: That's correct. If you remember, we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets. Now, when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals, there are three things to consider. First, the original condition of the market, second, our marketing numbers from the previous year, and third, our final sales figures for this year. Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts. If you look at the overhead, you'll see a graph... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005, the red line is the sales in 2006... As you can see, our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with, but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year. On the other hand, you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket.",

Look at this!\n#Person2#: What? Are you getting interested in nineteenth-century plays all of a sudden?\n#Person1#: Well, look at the words. Someone gave this book as a present, and wrote a note on the inside of the front cover. It's dated 1893. Maybe it's worth something.\n#Person2#: Everything on that shelf is worth fifty cents.\n#Person1#: But if this is the signature of someone who is well-known, it might bring a lot more. I hear William Shakespeare's signature is worth about a million dollars.\n#Person2#: Oh? I can hardly read what that one says. Who wrote it?\n#Person1#: The name looks like 'Harold Dickson'. Wasn't he a politician or something? I'm going to buy this book and see if I can find a name looks like that in the library.\n#Person2#: Good luck.

So I need some help.\n#Person2#: Well, first it is important to go through a good stretch. You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines.\n#Person1#: Yes, I know that. Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room. So I'm ready, I think. I can start using the machines.\n#Person2#: Alright. Great. Then we must get a card for you.\n#Person1#: What do you mean--a membership card? I already have one.\n#Person2#: No. Not that. I mean a training card. The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine. Here, let me show you.\n#Person1#: I'm ready.\n#Person2#: Now, you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed. So, when you go through the series of twelve machines, you enter in the number of repetitions you do. And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine.\n#Person1#: I see. So this card helps me to keep track of my progress.\n#Person2#: Yes. And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine. Today, I will go through the machines with you one by one. I will show you how to use them. And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you.\n#Person1#: Alright. Great.\n#Person2#: So you write your name and member number at the top of the card. And then, after you exercise each time, you file the card here.\n#Person1#: Great. Why don't we start on the machines?\n#Person2#: Are you alright? Can you do more?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry. I know there are still seven machines. But I'm exhausted.\n#Person2#: That's okay. Don't worry. It's important not to push yourself. Especially not at the beginning.\n#Person1#: What can I do though? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines.\n#Person2#: We can just go through them next time. It's no problem. Really. The most important thing is to know your limits. So if you feel burned out now, it is good to stop. Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back, then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks. Right?\n#Person1#: Yes.
