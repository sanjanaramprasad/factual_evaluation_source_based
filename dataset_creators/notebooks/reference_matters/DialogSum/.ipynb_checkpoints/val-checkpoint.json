He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.\n#Person1#: About what time would you think that they were there?\n#Person2#: Just after half past one to a quarter past two.\n#Person1#: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes.\n#Person2#: In fact, yes, as short as that.\n#Person1#: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?\n#Person2#: Fifty meters.\n#Person1#: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time?\n#Person2#: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well.\n#Person1#: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them.\n#Person2#: No, not at this stage.\n#Person1#: Well, thank you very much.",

No one makes me come home on time, and I probably wouldn't normally, but I now have a responsibility to my baby.\n#Person1#: What is your favorite part of having a daughter?\n#Person2#: It is so hard to narrow it down to one thing. I love the way she looks at me and admires me. She lets me feel so much love. She is innocent and pure. The best part of being with her is watching her go through every stage knowing there is somebody who loves her.\n#Person1#: What are your plans for the future?\n#Person2#: I am going to be a lawyer. Down the road, I hope to move out of Utah.\n#Person1#: What are some of your future goals and dreams?\n#Person2#: I want to start small. First and foremost, I am looking forward to graduating from high school. I eventually want to get married. Having a father figure in my baby's life is important to me because I missed out on that. I want to start modeling again, and I hope to keep up with my dancing and singing. It is also important to keep family traditions for me and my baby.\n#Person1#: What is your favorite quote?\n#Person2#: What happens in the dark will come out in the light. There is nothing that you can try to hide without it coming out sometime. It is important not to hide anything from yourself or anybody else.\n#Person1#: What advice would you give teens?\n#Person2#: Take things slow, and be a kid as long as you possibly can.

What kind of music do you like listening to?\n#Person2#: I like many kinds of music. Sometimes I listen to the music that has fast beat and is lively, like dance music. You know, I go to a disco almost every week. Sometimes it's too loud though. And I love classical music the most. I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work.\n#Person1#: How do you know about classical music?\n#Person1#: Actually, I specialized in classical music for my master study. Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Researches suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better. That's true. There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character.\n#Person2#: Good, I am pretty satisfied with your background. Do you think students should listen to more classical music than others and why?\n#Person1#: Yes. Sometimes students can be stressful. Listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.\n#Person2#: Okay, I think I've known enough of you. The interview is over.\n#Person1#: Thank you for your time.\n#Person2#: Oh, by the way. I think I may want to listen to some classical music. Do you have any suggestions?\n#Person1#: You can find plenty of recording on the internet. You can search and listen to different classical music and see which interests you the most. You can also buy them very cheaply online if you like them.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea. I'll try it.",
