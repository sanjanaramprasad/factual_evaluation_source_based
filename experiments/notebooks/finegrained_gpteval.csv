I twice gave my credit number but still the ticket is not delivered.
Air France: Of course, i give the file to an agent.
Air France: Please, be awared it could take 24 hours
Sybille: I can't wait so long. My son is only 16 year old and he has to sleep in the airport, with no mean to leave his luggage as he has no ticket.
Air France: Hello Sybille, we're very sorry . We could offer you a departure on flight DL140 from Minneapolis to Paris. We'll return to you.
Sybille: My  phone number is XXXX, please call me back as soon as possible
Sybille: Hello, i was again on line with people from the  short number. They told me that they've done everything possible but my payment can't be accepted because the flight is operated by Delta. Please consider a young stuck in US with no possibilites  for coming back just because of Delta and Air France sharing code, can't  share payment. Shame on you.
