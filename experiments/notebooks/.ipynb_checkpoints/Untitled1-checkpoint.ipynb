       "'Lee discusses his surprise at seeing a normally casual-dressed colleague wearing a dress shirt and suit jacket to work, jokingly suggesting that the strange occurrence could signal \"The Russians are coming.\" Andy teasingly suggests the individual might have a date later, or a client presentation. Lee then mentions pre-purchasing a digital copy of RoS CE, which resulted in bonus features such as a pet for World of Warcraft, decals for Starcraft 2, and a hero in an unreleased game. Lee and Andy briefly argue about the value of pre-order bonuses with Andy suggesting that Lee would get the same bonuses if he bought the game closer to the release date.'"
